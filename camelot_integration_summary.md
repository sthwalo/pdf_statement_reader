# Camelot Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Default Extraction Method
- Modified `process_single_pdf` function in `core/pdf_statement_processor.py` to use 'camelot' as the default extraction method
- Updated `batch_process_pdfs` function to use 'camelot' as the default extraction method
- Updated the main function in `modules/batch_processor.py` to set 'camelot' as the default extraction method

### 2. Updated Menu System
- Modified the extraction method menu in `menu_extract_single_pdf` function to:
  - Set camelot as the first option (option 1)
  - Make camelot the default selection
  - Reordered other extraction methods (regular, lattice, strict_lattice)
- Updated the extraction method mapping dictionary to reflect the new menu order
- Made the same changes to the batch processing menu

### 3. Updated Command-Line Arguments
- Updated `table_extractor.py` to set 'camelot' as the default extraction method instead of 'auto'
- Ensured all modules use 'camelot' as the default extraction method in their command-line arguments

### 4. Removed Lattice Comparison Code
- Removed the lattice comparison code from `camelot_parser.py` to eliminate dependencies on lattice extraction
- Kept lattice extraction code for backward compatibility but ensured it's not used by default

## Testing
To test the changes, you can run:

```bash
python3 core/pdf_statement_processor.py
```

This will start the interactive menu system where camelot is now the default extraction method.

For command-line usage:

```bash
python3 core/pdf_statement_processor.py --batch /path/to/pdf/directory --output-dir /path/to/output
```

This will batch process PDFs using camelot as the default extraction method.

## Next Steps
1. Consider removing the lattice extraction files completely if they are no longer needed
2. Add automated tests to validate camelot extraction integration and output consistency
3. Update documentation to reflect camelot as the default extraction method
4. Consider updating any remaining references to lattice extraction in the codebase
